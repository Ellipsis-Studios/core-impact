## Overview
Core Impact is an iOS/Android game developed by Ellipsis Studios.

At its core, Core Impact is a action-packed resource management game. The gameplay requires players to strategically balance between building up their planet and attacking other players. At the same time, players must also quickly manage the resources on their screen, deciding which to keep and which to fling away.

### Synopsis

Enter the newborn galaxy *Omission* as a young stardust core with hopes of becoming *Omission*’s first fully-fledged planet! However, it won’t be easy. Players compete with each other to build up their own cores while hindering other player’s progress by strategically managing their local balls of stardust. Get excited for thrilling, fast-paced gameplay in the race of the biggest!

## How to Play

### Create or Join Room
One player hosts the game by clicking "New Game" in the main menu. All others join the game by clicking "Join Game" and typing in the code on the host player's screen. The game begins when the host presses "Start Game".

### Gameplay
Drag stardust of the same color as your outermost layer to increase its thickness. Drag stardust of a different color to your outermost layer and it will decrease in thickness.

Fling stardust to other players' screens by throwing it at their progress bars in the corners of your screen.
