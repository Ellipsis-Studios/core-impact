//  Unless you are making a point-and-click adventure game, every single
//  game is going to need some sort of collision detection.  In a later
//  lab, we will see how to do this with a physics engine. For now, we use
//  custom physics.
//
//  You might ask why we need this file when we have Box2d. That is because
//  we are trying to make this code as close to that of 3152 as possible. At
//  this point in the semester of 3152, we had not covered Box2d.
//
//  However, you will notice that this is NOT A CLASS.  The collision
//  controller in 3152 did not have any state to speak of (it had some cache
//  objects that are completely unnecessary in C++.  So we can just do this
//  as a collection of functions.  But if you do that, we recommend that
//  you put the functions together in a namespace, like we have done here.
