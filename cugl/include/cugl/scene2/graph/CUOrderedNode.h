//  This module provides a scene graph node that can arbitrary reorder the
//  rendering of its children.  The lack of this feature has frustrated the
//  students for years. It is the primary issue that has limited the scene
//  graph to UI elements, and made it less suitable for character animation.
//
//  Render order is managed by the priority attribute in the base SceneNode
//  class. You should set these values to manually arrange your scene graph
//  elements
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.

/**
 * This is a scene graph node to arbitrary render orders
 *
 * One of the drawbacks of a scene graph is that it must always render with
 * a pre-order traversal. This is the natural traversal for UI elements, but
 * it is not convenient for character animation (where child components may
 * need to be layered differently).
 *
 * This node is introduced to solve this problem. For the most part, this
 * node operates just like {@link SceneNode}. However, it allows you to
 * resort the render order of the descendents of this node. Simply choose
 * any one of the {@link OrderedNode#Order} values available. These orders
 * are applied to the {@link SceneNode#getPriority} value of each node in
 * the scene graph.
 *
 * Any order other than a pre-order traversal comes as a cost, as we must
 * cache the scene graph transform and color context of each node (these
 * values are computed naturally from the recursive calls of a pre-order
 * traversal). In addition, we must call std::sort (currently IntroSort)
 * on all of the descendants every single render pass. However, as long
 * as the number of children of this node is reasonably sized, this should
 * not be an issue.
 *
 * An OrderedNode is a render barrier. This means that if one OrderedNode
 * (the first node) is a descendant of another OrderedNode (the second node),
 * the first node will be rendered as a unit with the priority of that
 * node. So it is impossible to interleave other descendants of the second
 * node with descendants of the first node.  This is necessary as the
 * two OrderedNodes may have incompatible orderings.
